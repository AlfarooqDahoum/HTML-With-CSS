    <h3>Introduction to reactJS:</h3><br>
        <p>React (speficially ReactJS) is a JS library that aims to simplify the intricate process of building interactive user interfaces
        In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks.
        These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application's entire user interface.
