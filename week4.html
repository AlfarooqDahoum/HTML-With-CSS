        <p>represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page</p>
        <p>For example, the DOM specifies that the querySelectorAll method in this code snippet must return a list of all the elements in the document</p>

    <h3>Knowing the use of the life cycle for software development:</h3><br>
    <p>Life Cycle (software development) is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process</p>
    <p>the way this is achieved is:</p> <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Planning and Requirement Analysis</li>
        <li>Defining Requirements</li>
        <li>Designing the Product Architecture</li>
        <li>Building or Developing the Product</li>
        <li>Testing the Product</li>
