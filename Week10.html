<!--FULL STACK-->
    <h3>Working on a Project:</h3><br>
        <p>We have been put into groups to work out on a project to have a responsive webpage. The Idea me and my group planned out was a E-commerce website that would sell Protein products</p>
        <p>We put into mind that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It has to spell Protein specific product (Protein Powder, Shakes, Snacks etc.)</li>
            <li>The user can sign up and login to have an account</li>
            <li>Have good design with the page (have reviews shown and the stars too)</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./images/FSProject.PNG">
        <p>The end product should look like this, not entierly but if we can get it to look good, then thats what matters</p>
