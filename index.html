        <br>
        <p>I statred my life by building computers, gathering components and testing it for any issues or broken parts. Whilst that was happening, I was working on coding to improve on a new skill since my pc building skill can't land me a better future of see any progression towards it. After I left my job, 
            coding was my next chapter in my story. The challenge of problem-solving and the thrill of creating new, innovative solutions fascinated me deeply.</p><br>
        <p>My primary goal? It's all about advancing my coding skills. This page acts as my personal log, documenting my journey through this bootcamp. Here, I'll share my triumphs, the obstacles I overcome, and the ingenious tips and tricks I pick up along the way. Join me as I navigate the captivating world
            of coding, evolving one step at a time.</p>
